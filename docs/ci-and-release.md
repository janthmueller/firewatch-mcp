# CI and Release

This project ships with ready-to-use GitHub Actions for CI, release, and npm publishing.

Workflows

- CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

  - Triggers on push to `main` and `develop`.
  - Matrix: Node 20 and 22.
  - Steps: install → lint → format check → typecheck → test → build.
  - Optional: uploads coverage to Codecov if `coverage/lcov.info` exists and `CODECOV_TOKEN` is set.
  - Uploads the `dist/` artifact (Node 20 job) for quick download.

- PR Check (.github/workflows/pr-check.yml)

  - Fast checks on PR open/update: lint, format check, typecheck, unit tests, build.

- Release (.github/workflows/release.yml)

  - On tag push `v*`: runs tests, builds `dist/`, creates a GitHub Release with a tarball of `dist` + metadata.

- Publish (.github/workflows/publish.yml)
  - On tag push `v*.*.*` (and via manual dispatch): builds and publishes to npm with provenance.
  - Uses npm trusted publishing via GitHub Actions OIDC; no `NPM_TOKEN` is required.

Secrets

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (optional): used by Codecov upload step (CI). The step is skipped if the token or coverage file is missing.

Release flow

1. Bump version in `package.json` (keep 0.x until API is stable):
   - `npm version patch` (or minor)
   - Commit the change
2. Create and push the tag (must match package.json):
   - `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`
3. `release` creates a GitHub Release; `publish` publishes to npm.
4. For npm publishing to work, the `firewatch-mcp` package on npm must trust the GitHub Actions workflow `publish.yml` for the `janthmueller/firewatch-mcp` repository.

Windows Integration Tests

- On Windows, vitest has known issues with process forking when running integration tests that spawn Firefox.
- See upstream: https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-devtools-mcp/issues/33
- To work around this, we use a separate test runner (`scripts/run-integration-tests-windows.mjs`) that runs integration tests directly via Node.js without vitest's process isolation.
- The CI workflow detects Windows and automatically uses this runner instead of vitest for integration tests.
- Unit tests still run via vitest on all platforms.

Notes

- If you want Codecov upload to run, switch CI test step to `npm run test:coverage` or generate `coverage/lcov.info`.
- Provenance is enabled for npm publish (Node 20+).
- Trusted publishing requires GitHub-hosted runners plus npm trusted publisher configuration on the package settings page.
- Use `@latest` in README examples to encourage npx usage.
